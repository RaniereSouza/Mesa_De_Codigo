#it can be dangerous to keep class attributes as public! it means that it can be overwritten by anyone!
#for example, you can do things like this:
person2.name = "Rodrigo"

#Person 2 now has "Rodrigo" as it's name!
person2.greet()

#from now on, we will follow the rule of encapsulation, and all the classes we use will have private attributes

#let's instantiate some Cats!
cat1 = Cat("Tom") #instance from superclass of JapaneseCat and BrazilianCat
cat2 = JapaneseCat("Yoruichi") #instance of a subclass of Cat
cat3 = BrazilianCat("Satanas") #instance of a subclass of Cat

#we will now observe some polymorphism in action: using the same method name, and having different behaviours

#this is the original talk method in the Cat superclass:
cat1.talk()

#those are different versions of the talk method, overriden by each of the subclasses
cat2.talk()
cat3.talk()

#this method was also overloaded in the BrazilianCat class, which means it was written with a different behaviour if it receives different arguments
cat3.talk("outro gato!")
